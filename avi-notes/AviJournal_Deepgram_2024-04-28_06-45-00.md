### Overview

I looked into 2 github projects

1. [Not Official] Live Transcription With Python and FastAPI (https://github.com/deepgram-devs/
live-transcription-fastapi)

    - Just someone wrote this client sample 2 years back and it doesnt work.

2. Official Deepgram Python SDK
   Repo(https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk) showing usage examples

### Codebase
- `deepgram` folder has the complementary code - like 
    - `audio/microphone` having
  needed code for capturing audio wav stream from microphone
    - etc.

- `examples` folder has the actual example code and detailed/specific
  instructions
  - See README.md's
    [Examples](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#examples)
    section for a clear outline of all examples.

- HTTP-Streaming example does not record the audio from microphjone using a
  browser, but instead is capturing audio streaming from a 3rd party service BBC.

- The codebase includes a variety of management APIs and features for live audio
  transcription, prerecorded audio analysis, and text analysis.

- Debugging and testing are well-supported within the code, aiding in maintenance and further development.

### Assessment
- I am leaning towards a solution that captures client side audio and then
  passes that as a stream to FastAPI server and this would be easily
  transformable into web, mobile, and desktop applications.
- Explore the possibility of a JavaScript implementation for broader accessibility and integration ease.
- Evaluate the use of MP3 streaming to reduce data transmission size and potentially lower costs associated with data quotas on Deepgram's service.


### Additional Features
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities are available, with a selection of voices to choose from, enhancing the versatility of the client.

### Summary
- The system appears robust and capable of handling a range of audio processing tasks with various outputs.
- Decisions on whether to use a FastAPI or a client-only version depend on specific needs and the technical environment.
- Future work may involve simplifying the audio capture process and integrating more advanced streaming options to optimize performance and cost-efficiency.

### Next Steps
- Reassess the package dependencies and update or replace them as necessary.
- Conduct further testing on the integration of microphone and streaming functionalities to ensure reliability.
- Verify pricing and data quota implications on the Deepgram pricing webpage to manage project costs effectively.
