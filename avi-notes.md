## Qn: Analysis of [`examples/streaming/microphone/main.py`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.py) code

This Python script uses the Deepgram SDK to perform live transcription of audio input. Deepgram is a speech recognition service that can transcribe audio in real-time or from stored files.

The script starts by importing necessary modules and initializing an empty list is_finals to store final transcriptions. The main function is defined to handle the transcription process.

A DeepgramClient object is created without any specific configuration. This client object is used to establish a live transcription connection with Deepgram's servers.

Several callback functions are defined to handle various events during the transcription process. These include on_open, on_message, on_metadata, on_speech_started, on_utterance_end, on_close, on_error, and on_unhandled. Each of these functions is designed to handle a specific event during the transcription process, such as when the connection is opened, when a message (transcription result) is received, when metadata is received, when speech starts, when an utterance ends, when the connection is closed, when an error occurs, and when an unhandled event occurs.

These callback functions are then registered to the dg_connection object using the on method, which associates each event with its corresponding handler.

Next, a LiveOptions object is defined to specify the configuration for the live transcription. This includes the model to use for transcription, the language of the audio, the audio format details, and other settings related to the transcription process.

The script then attempts to start the transcription process with the specified options and addons. If the connection fails, it prints an error message and returns.
      
    
## Qn: In the code above, is it possible to locally save the raw audio that is being send to deepgram?

Yes, it is possible to save the raw audio locally while it's being sent to Deepgram for transcription. However, this feature is not built into the Deepgram SDK, so you would need to implement it yourself.

You can do this by modifying the code that reads audio data from the microphone and sends it to Deepgram. You would need to add code to write the audio data to a local file at the same time.

Here is a rough example of how you could modify the code to save the audio data to a file:

This code will save the audio data in a file named 'audio.wav'. You can change the filename to whatever you want. The audio parameters (number of channels, sample width, and frame rate) should match the audio data you're recording.

Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real application, you would need to handle exceptions and make sure the wave file is properly closed even if an error occurs.
